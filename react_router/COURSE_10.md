## Fixing the "cannot GET *url*" error in React Route

You’re ahead of your deadline and you might just leave work early to enjoy those extra 
few hours of the weekend. You decide to do one last pass-through of your app before 
taking off. "That button should have a little more border radius to it." you think. 
You change it, hit refresh, your app breaks. It’s not your typical error. If it were, 
you wouldn’t have sworn under your breath. `Cannot read property 'state' of undefined`, 
no worries. You’ve seen that one plenty of times. This one was different. It wasn’t even 
that the app crashed, it’s deeper than that. You stare at your monitor through your 
fingers. That’s it. That’s all you get. Your whole app breaks on refresh and all you get 
is three words.

>   Cannot GET /dashboard

"Probably a hot module replacement issue. Just an anomaly" - you optimistically convince 
yourself. To validate your assumption you restart the app. "Widget page looks good. Navigating 
works fine. Let’s try refresh again."

>   Cannot GET /settings

Defeat. No other words describe it so perfectly. There goes your long weekend. There might 
even go your whole weekend since you have literally no idea what’s going on. Luckily for you, 
you found this post. Meta, right?

First, let’s establish the problem you’re having. To do that, we’ll need to talk about how the
browser and client side routers work. 

In the old days, things were simple. If you wanted to get the contents of /dashboard, the 
browser would make a GET request to your server, by inspecting the path portion of the URL 
the server would figure out that the user was requesting the /dashboard page. It would then 
grab that page and send back to the browser as a response. Then these things called client 
side routers (CSR) came into the picture. With a CSR (like React Router), you’re no longer 
making requests to your server every time you change routes. Instead, your CSR is just handling 
that for you locally on the browser. So when you go to /dashboard, instead of making a GET 
request to your server, your CSR is using a browser API called history.pushState to manually 
change the URL and then it renders the View for that specific route - all without causing 
a page refresh.

Let’s look at that process a little more in depth.

The first time a user loads your app (i.e. visits your website), they don’t have any JavaScript 
loaded. That means no React and no React Router - so the first request will always be to your 
server. Then, assuming there was a successful GET request, all your JavaScript loads and React 
Router confidently hijacks your routing. From here on out, any other route changes in your app 
will be handled by React Router.

Notice the issue yet? React Router can only load after the first successful GET request to your 
server (or /). The reason for the dreaded Cannot GET /* error is because, if you’re at /dashboard 
and then hit refresh, the browser will make a GET request to /dashboard which will fail since you 
have no logic on your server for handling that request (since React Router is supposed to do it).

In case the issue is still fuzzy, here’s another example. Say you are really proud of the app you’ve 
been working on and you want to share it with your Mom. The app is Tic Tac Toe and has three routes,
/, /play, and leaderboard. You send your Mom the link https://tictactyler.com/play since you want 
to play with her. When she enters that URL into her browser and hits enter, what happens? At this 
point she has no JavaScript, no React, and no React Router. The browser makes a GET request to 
/play and, since you’re relying on React Router to handle all the routing logic (but she has 
no React Router yet), the app crashes and she gets Cannot GET /play.

Now the big question, how do we fix this?

The root of the issue is that you’re relying entirely on client side routing without setting up 
any logic to handle server side routing. There are two main ideas for solving this problem. 
The first, set up both client and server side routing. The second, redirect all server requests 
to /index.htmlwhich will download all the JS resources and allow React Router to take it from 
there. Most of the solutions we’ll look at involve the latter as it’s more simple. 

### Hash History

TBH, this one is kind of a hack. Have you ever seen those URLs with # in them? They’re using Hash History. The idea is by appending a # to the end of the root of your URL, anything after that # won’t be sent to the server. So if the URL was https://tm.io/#/courses, the browser would make a GET request to https://tm.io, get back all the JavaScript, React Router would then load, see /courses, and show the proper view for that route. React Router provides a HashRouter component you could use that will get you hash based routing, but honestly unless you REALLY need it, there are better options.
Catch-all

If you already have a server you’re using, this is probably your best bet. The main idea here is that you redirect all of your server requests to /index.html. The outcome is similar to Hash History. Any request that is made to your server will respond with the index page (and then fetch any JS resources you need), React Router will then take over and load the appropriate view. The actual code for this varies on which type of you have. Here are some examples

Express
```
app.get('/*', function(req, res) {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'path/to/your/index.html'), function(err) {
    if (err) {
      res.status(500).send(err)
    }
  })
})
```

Appache .htaccess

```
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

Nginx .conf

```
location / {
  if (!-e $request_filename){
    rewrite ^(.*)$ /index.html break;
  }
}
```

### No Server

For those blessed developers who don’t have to worry about managing a server, there are options for you as well and they (typically) come baked into the hosting service you’re using. There are obviously a lot of different variations here but you need to find a service that supports client side routers. For example, if you host with Firebase, one of the questions is asks you are

>   Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)?

Netlify also supports client-side routing, you just need to create a /_redirects file with the following rule

```
/*  /index.html  200
```

As you can probably guess, that tells Netlify to redirect all requests to .index.html.


### Webpack / Development

This section is for everyone who ran into this problem in development using webpack-dev-server.. Just as above, what we need to do it tell Webpack Dev Sever to redirect all server requests to /index.html. There are just two properties in your webpack config you need to set to do this, publicPath and historyApiFallback.

```
publicPath: '/',
historyApiFallback: true,
```

publicPath allows you to specify the base path for all the assets within your application. historyAPIFallback will redirect 404s to /index.html.

Here’s an example of a basic webpack config file with both options in case you need it.

```
var path = require('path');
var HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
module.exports = {
  entry: './app/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'index_bundle.js',
    publicPath: '/'
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.(js)$/, use: 'babel-loader' },
      { test: /\.css$/, use: [ 'style-loader', 'css-loader' ]}
    ]
  },
  devServer: {
    historyApiFallback: true,
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: 'app/index.html'
    })
  ]
};
```

That’s it. Go enjoy your weekend now
